#
# FILE: .gitattributes
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This file is used to define attributes for specific paths or files within
#   the Git repository. Its primary role is to ensure consistent handling of
#   files across different operating systems and development environments.
#
# METHODOLOGY:
#   This configuration ensures that all text files are automatically normalized
#   to use Unix-style line endings (LF) within the Git repository. When a team
#   member on Windows checks out the files, Git will automatically convert these
#   line endings to Windows-style (CRLF), and vice-versa. This prevents
#   spurious changes from appearing in `git status` due to line-ending
#   differences alone.
