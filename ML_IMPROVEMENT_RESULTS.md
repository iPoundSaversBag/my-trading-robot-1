### üìà **Key Findings**

1. **Best Approach**: **Enhanced Model (v2)** with advanced feature engineering
   - Higher macro F1 score (0.303 vs 0.268)
   - Better overall accuracy (45.3%)
   - More stable predictions

2. **Feature Engineering Impact**: 
   - Increased from 13 to 32 features
   - Top performing features:
     - `breakout_volume_confirm` (11.14% importance)
